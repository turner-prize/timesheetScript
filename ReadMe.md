A little command line tool for quickly logging projects and work each day.
If you schedule it to run at 4:45pm each day it'll log to a sqlite file and you can get your timesheets filled in at the end of the month quicker.

Things to add:
    A report generator to export a set amount of days into a csv file quickly.
    A settings folder to allow you to easily set variables which an be used to run reports such as the above.
